# <img src="src/pack.png" height=25> **Multitool**

Do you **hate it** when your whole inventory is **cluttered by tools**?

Well, with this data pack you can **combine all the tools** into the **Multitool**.

## **Features**
If you look at a block, the Multitool **switches to a tool suited to break that block**.

When **sneaking** while looking at **tillable blocks**, the Multitool swaps to a **hoe**, so you can create fresh farmland.

You can **enchant** the Multitool!
It supports any enchantment that you can normally slap on a tool.

The tool **only loses durability 30% of the time** since it is made from 4 tools.<br>
This only increases the effective durability by 3.333 times and not 4 times.

Mutlitool even supports **resource packs**, like [this one](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/multitool-halberds/) by [Crafterick](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/craftrick/), it turns the **Multitool into a halberd**!

## **How to get**

To **craft** a Multitool, you just need to **combine all four types of tools** of the same material in the crafting grid.

You will see a `Knowledge Book` as the crafting result, take it out and it will get replaced by the Multitool.

If you are OP you can **give yourself the tool** by running the following command:
```mcfunction
loot give @s loot ps-multitool:{material}_multitool
```
Make sure to replace `{material}` with one of `golden`, `wooden`, `stone`, `diamond` or `netherite`.
